Plant Variability Impact on Soybean Yield in Alabama

# Abstract

Several studies have demonstrated that nonuniform spatial and temporal distribution of plants along the sowing row, mainly caused by distribution failures during the sowing or low seed quality, results in biomass variability and reduced grain yield. However, there is lack of information of longitudinal distribution of seeds along the fields and its impact on grain yield. Hence, the objective of this project was to evaluate how variability among plants in the same sowing row can impact soybean grain yield. We conducted a statewide assessment of plant variability in commercial soybean fields across Alabama state, totaling 51 sites. For each site, 10 consecutive plants in a row were collected at 3 different points across the field. The general parameters measured were plant height, number of pods, and number of lateral branches measured for each individual plant collected. Later, plants were passed in a single plant thresher to collect the seeds and seed weight per plant was estimated. The results showed that, within the field, variability (represented by the standard deviation) in seed weight per plant ranging from 0.6 to 23.3 grams (4.7 grams in average), and plant height between 1.9 to 16.2 cm (6.1 cm in average). 

# Objectives

1. Asses the soybean canopy plant-to-plant variability in the field.
2. Evaluate how this variability among plants in the same sowing row can impact soybean grain yield.
